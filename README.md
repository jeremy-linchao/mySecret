### Why this tool?
As there is more and more websites, password storage becomes a import problem. For me, "an old man" with poor memory, I cann't remeber so many passwrod, not metion that a lot website reminds u to change your password frequentyly and not use the used one. Although there is solution like "onepassword", I perfer have my own control, so that's mySecret comes.

### Technical Stack
1.Frontend part: react + redux + fabric-react(not asking me why I use this UI library, I use it just for practicing)

2.Backend part: swagger-node to provide the simple RESTFUL API service and elasticsearch for store

### How to use
1. Frontend: cd frontend && npm start
2. Backend: cd backend && swagger project start

### Plan
Since this is just a inital version, there is a lot sceneary, for example: store personal infomation, diary so on. Of course, the UI now is ugly and need to be improved.
